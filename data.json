        "description": "The Najm-802 advanced long-range radar was developed by the Islamic Republic of Iran to detect a wide range of airborne targets as well as to serve as fire control radar in long-range engagements. The Najm-802 radar includes 5,120 receiving and transmitting modules operating in the S-band (decimeter range). The radar system seems to be well suited to spot ballistic missiles as well as high-precision weapons built around stealth technology. The Najm-802 radar entered service in the 2010s and maybe related to the Bavar 373 air defense system also developed by the Islamic Republic of Iran.",
