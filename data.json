The radar system seems to be well suited to spot ballistic missiles as well as high-precision weapons built around stealth technology.

This radar can be used in all weather conditions and is a modern, coherent processing radar and has all the semiconductor components that can detect and track aerial targets up to 480 kilometers as well as low-level targets. The Matla-ul-fajr-2 radar, like all previous generations, all components of the system are portable by a trailer, and the radar feed can be carried out by two diesel generators installed on it or by city electricity. In the coherent processing method used in the Matla-ul-fajr-2 radar, all transmitted signals having same phase and their random effects are prevented, while in the non-coherent there is a phase difference between signals. From the results of such a method, the ability to detect the smallest speed difference of the targets is due to the difference of the recursive signals that had no difference (actually phase difference) when sending. There is also less interference and better signal advantages in this method than the non-coherent method.",
